MR. O
Bennet B-Person
was O
among O
the O
earliest O
of O
those O
who O
waited O
on O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
. O

He O
had O
always O
intended O
to O
visit O
him, O

though O
to O
the O
last O
always O
assuring O
his O
wife O
that O
he O
should O
not O
go; O

and O
till O
the O
evening O
after O
the O
visit O
was O
paid, O
she O
had O
no O
knowledge O
of O
it. O

It O
was O
then O
disclosed O
in O
the O
following O
manner. O

Observing O
his O
second O
daughter O
employed O
in O
trimming O
a O
hat, O

he O
suddenly O
addressed O
her O
with, O

"I O
hope O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
will O
like O
it, O
Lizzy B-Person
." O

"We O
are O
not O
in O
a O
way O
to O
know O
what O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
likes," O

said O
her O
mother O
resentfully, O
"since O
we O
are O
not O
to O
visit." O

"But O
you O
forget, O
mama," O
said O
Elizabeth, O
"that O
we O
shall O
meet O
him O
at O
the O
assemblies, O

and O
that O
Mrs. O
Long B-Person
has O
promised O
to O
introduce O
him." O

"I O
do O
not O
believe O
Mrs. O
Long B-Person
will O
do O
any O
such O
thing. O

She O
has O
two O
nieces O
of O
her O
own. O
She O
is O
a O
selfish, O
hypocritical O
woman, O

and O
I O
have O
no O
opinion O
of O
her." O

"No O
more O
have O
I," O
said O
Mr. O
Bennet B-Person
; O
"and O
I O
am O
glad O
to O
find O
that O
you O
do O
not O
depend O
on O
her O
serving O
you." O

Mrs. O
Bennet B-Person
deigned O
not O
to O
make O
any O
reply; O

but O
unable O
to O
contain O
herself, O
began O
scolding O
one O
of O
her O
daughters. O

"Don't O
keep O
coughing O
so, O
Kitty B-Person
, O
for O
heaven's O
sake! O
Have O
a O
little O
compassion O
on O
my O
nerves. O
You O
tear O
them O
to O
pieces." O

" O
Kitty B-Person
has O
no O
discretion O
in O
her O
coughs," O
said O
her O
father; O
"she O
times O
them O
ill." O

"I O
do O
not O
cough O
for O
my O
own O
amusement," O
replied O
Kitty B-Person
fretfully. O

"When O
is O
your O
next O
ball O
to O
be, O
Lizzy B-Person
?" O

"To-morrow O
fortnight." O

"Aye, O
so O
it O
is," O
cried O
her O
mother, O
"and O
Mrs. O
Long B-Person
does O
not O
come O
back O
till O
the O
day O
before; O
so O
it O
will O
be O
impossible O
for O
her O
to O
introduce O
him, O
for O
she O
will O
not O
know O
him O
herself." O

"Then, O
my O
dear, O
you O
may O
have O
the O
advantage O
of O
your O
friend, O
and O
introduce O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
to O
her." O

"Impossible, O
Mr. O
Bennet B-Person
, O
impossible, O
when O
I O
am O
not O
acquainted O
with O
him O
myself; O
how O
can O
you O
be O
so O
teazing?" O

"I O
honour O
your O
circumspection. O

A O
fortnight's O
acquaintance O
is O
certainly O
very O
little. O

One O
cannot O
know O
what O
a O
man O
really O
is O
by O
the O
end O
of O
a O
fortnight. O
But O
if O
we O
do O
not O
venture, O

somebody O
else O
will; O
and O
after O
all, O
Mrs. O
Long B-Person
and O
her O
nieces O
must O
stand O
their O
chance; O

and O
therefore, O
as O
she O
will O
think O
it O
an O
act O
of O
kindness, O

if O
you O
decline O
the O
office, O
I O
will O
take O
it O
on O
myself." O

The O
girls O
stared O
at O
their O
father. O

Mrs. O
Bennet B-Person
said O
only, O
"Nonsense, O
nonsense!" O

"What O
can O
be O
the O
meaning O
of O
that O
emphatic O
exclamation?" O
cried O
he. O

"Do O
you O
consider O
the O
forms O
of O
introduction, O
and O
the O
stress O
that O
is O
laid O
on O
them, O
as O
nonsense? O

I O
cannot O
quite O
agree O
with O
you O
there. O
What O
say O
you, O
Mary B-Person
? O

for O
you O
are O
a O
young O
lady O
of O
deep O
reflection O
I O
know, O
and O
read O
great O
books, O
and O
make O
extracts." O

Mary B-Person
wished O
to O
say O
something O
very O
sensible, O
but O
knew O
not O
how. O

"While O
Mary B-Person
is O
adjusting O
her O
ideas," O
he O
continued, O
"let O
us O
return O
to O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
." O

"I O
am O
sick O
of O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
," O
cried O
his O
wife. O

"I O
am O
sorry O
to O
hear O
that; O
but O
why O
did O
not O
you O
tell O
me O
so O
before? O

If O
I O
had O
known O
as O
much O
this O
morning, O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
called O
on O
him. O

It O
is O
very O
unlucky; O

but O
as O
I O
have O
actually O
paid O
the O
visit, O
we O
cannot O
escape O
the O
acquaintance O
now." O

The O
astonishment O
of O
the O
ladies O
was O
just O
what O
he O
wished; O

that O
of O
Mrs. O
Bennet B-Person
perhaps O
surpassing O
the O
rest; O

though O
when O
the O
first O
tumult O
of O
joy O
was O
over, O

she O
began O
to O
declare O
that O
it O
was O
what O
she O
had O
expected O
all O
the O
while. O

"How O
good O
it O
was O
in O
you, O
my O
dear O
Mr. O
Bennet B-Person
! O

But O
I O
knew O
I O
should O
persuade O
you O
at O
last. O

I O
was O
sure O
you O
loved O
our O
girls O
too O
well O
to O
neglect O
such O
an O
acquaintance. O

Well, O
how O
pleased O
I O
am! O
and O
it O
is O
such O
a O
good O
joke, O
too, O

that O
you O
should O
have O
gone O
this O
morning, O
and O
never O
said O
a O
word O
about O
it O
till O
now." O

"Now, O
Kitty B-Person
, O
you O
may O
cough O
as O
much O
as O
you O
chuse," O

said O
Mr. O
Bennet B-Person
; O
and, O
as O
he O
spoke, O
he O
left O
the O
room, O
fatigued O
with O
the O
raptures O
of O
his O
wife. O

"What O
an O
excellent O
father O
you O
have, O
girls," O
said O
she, O

when O
the O
door O
was O
shut. O
"I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
you O
will O
ever O
make O
him O
amends O
for O
his O
kindness; O

or O
me O
either, O
for O
that O
matter. O
At O
our O
time O
of O
life, O
it O
is O
not O
so O
pleasant O
I O
can O
tell O
you, O

to O
be O
making O
new O
acquaintance O
every O
day; O

but O
for O
your O
sakes, O
we O
would O
do O
any O
thing. O
Lydia B-Person
, O
my O
love, O
though O
you O
are O
the O
youngest, O

I O
dare O
say O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
will O
dance O
with O
you O
at O
the O
next O
ball B-Misc
." O

"Oh!" O
said O
Lydia B-Person
stoutly, O

"I O
am O
not O
afraid; O
for O
though O
I O
am O
the O
youngest, O
I'm O
the O
tallest." O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
evening O
was O
spent O
in O
conjecturing O
how O
soon O
he O
would O
return O

Mr. O
Bennet B-Person
's O
visit, O
and O
determining O
when O
they O
should O
ask O
him O
to O
dinner. O


ELIZABETH B-Person
, O
as O
they O
drove O
along, O

watched O
for O
the O
first O
appearance O
of O
Pemberley B-Misc
Woods I-Misc
with O
some O
perturbation; O

and O
when O
at O
length O
they O
turned O
in O
at O
the O
lodge B-Misc
, O
her O
spirits O
were O
in O
a O
high O
flutter. O

The O
park B-Misc
was O
very O
large, O
and O
contained O
great O
variety O
of O
ground B-Misc
. O

They O
entered O
it O
in O
one O
of O
its O
lowest O
points, O
and O
drove O
for O
some O
time O
through O
a O
beautiful O
wood B-Misc
, O
stretching O
over O
a O
wide O
extent. O

Elizabeth B-Person
's O
mind O
was O
too O
full O
for O
conversation, O

but O
she O
saw O
and O
admired O
every O
remarkable O
spot O
and O
point O
of O
view. O

They O
gradually O
ascended O
for O
half O
a O
mile, O

and O
then O
found O
themselves O
at O
the O
top O
of O
a O
considerable O
eminence, O

where O
the O
wood B-Misc
ceased, O
and O
the O
eye O
was O
instantly O
caught O
by O
Pemberley B-Location
House I-Location
, O

situated O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
a O
valley B-Misc
, O
into O
which O
the O
road B-Misc
, O

with O
some O
abruptness, O
wound. O

It O
was O
a O
large, O
handsome, O
stone O
building B-Misc
, O
standing O
well O
on O
rising O
ground B-Misc
, O
and O
backed O
by O
a O
ridge O
of O
high O
wood B-Misc
y O
hills B-Misc
; O
-- O
and O
in O
front, O

a O
stream O
of O
some O
natural O
importance O
was O
swelled O
into O
greater, O

but O
without O
any O
artificial O
appearance. O
Its O
banks B-Misc
were O
neither O
formal, O
nor O
falsely O
adorned. O

Elizabeth B-Person
was O
delighted. O
She O
had O
never O
seen O
a O
place O
for O
which O
nature O
had O
done O
more, O

or O
where O
natural O
beauty O
had O
been O
so O
little O
counteracted O
by O
an O
awkward O
taste. O

They O
were O
all O
of O
them O
warm O
in O
their O
admiration; O
and O
at O
that O
moment O
she O
felt O
that O
to O
be O
mistress O
of O
Pemberley B-Location
might O
be O
something! O

They O
descended O
the O
hill B-Misc
, O
crossed O
the O
bridge B-Misc
, O
and O
drove O
to O
the O
door B-Misc
; O

and, O
while O
examining O
the O
nearer O
aspect O
of O
the O
house, O

all O
her O
apprehensions O
of O
meeting O
its O
owner O
returned. O

She O
dreaded O
lest O
the O
chambermaid O
had O
been O
mistaken. O

On O
applying O
to O
see O
the O
place, O
they O
were O
admitted O
into O
the O
hall B-Location
; O
and O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O

as O
they O
waited O
for O
the O
housekeeper, O
had O
leisure O
to O
wonder O
at O
her O
being O
where O
she O
was. O

The O
housekeeper O
came; O
a O
respectable-looking, O
elderly O
woman, O
much O
less O
fine, O
and O
more O
civil, O

than O
she O
had O
any O
notion O
of O
finding O
her. O

They O
followed O
her O
into O
the O
dining B-Location
parlour I-Location
. O
It O
was O
a O
large, O
well-proportioned O
room, O

handsomely O
fitted O
up. O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O
after O
slightly O
surveying O
it, O

went O
to O
a O
window B-Misc
to O
enjoy O
its O
prospect. O

The O
hill B-Misc
, O
crowned O
with O
wood B-Misc
, O
from O
which O
they O
had O
descended, O

receiving O
increased O
abruptness O
from O
the O
distance, O
was O
a O
beautiful O
object. O

Every O
disposition O
of O
the O
ground B-Misc
was O
good; O

and O
she O
looked O
on O
the O
whole O
scene O
-- O
the O
river B-Misc
, O

the O
trees B-Misc
scattered O
on O
its O
banks B-Misc
, O

and O
the O
winding O
of O
the O
valley B-Misc
, O
as O
far O
as O
she O
could O
trace O
it O
-- O
with O
delight. O

As O
they O
passed O
into O
other O
rooms, O
these O
objects O
were O
taking O
different O
positions; O

but O
from O
every O
window B-Misc
there O
were O
beauties O
to O
be O
seen. O

The O
rooms O
were O
lofty O
and O
handsome, O

and O
their O
furniture O
suitable O
to O
the O
fortune O
of O
their O
proprietor; O

but O
Elizabeth B-Person
saw, O
with O
admiration O
of O
his O
taste, O

that O
it O
was O
neither O
gaudy O
nor O
uselessly O
fine; O

with O
less O
of O
splendor, O
and O
more O
real O
elegance, O
than O
the O
furniture O
of O
Rosings. O

"And O
of O
this O
place," O
thought O
she, O
"I O
might O
have O
been O
mistress! O

With O
these O
rooms O
I O
might O
now O
have O
been O
familiarly O
acquainted! O

Instead O
of O
viewing O
them O
as O
a O
stranger, O

I O
might O
have O
rejoiced O
in O
them O
as O
my O
own, O
and O
welcomed O
to O
them O
as O
visitors O
my O
uncle O
and O
aunt. O

-- O
But O
no," O
-- O
recollecting O
herself, O
-- O
"that O
could O
never O
be: O

my O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
would O
have O
been O
lost O
to O
me: O
I O
should O
not O
have O
been O
allowed O
to O
invite O
them." O

This O
was O
a O
lucky O
recollection O
-- O
it O
saved O
her O
from O
something O
like O
regret. O

She O
longed O
to O
enquire O
of O
the O
housekeeper O
whether O
her O
master O
were O
really O
absent, O

but O
had O
not O
courage O
for O
it. O

At O
length, O
however, O
the O
question O
was O
asked O
by O
her O
uncle; O

and O
she O
turned O
away O
with O
alarm, O
while O
Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
replied O
that O
he O
was, O

adding, O
"but O
we O
expect O
him O
tomorrow, O
with O
a O
large O
party O
of O
friends." O

How O
rejoiced O
was O
Elizabeth B-Person
that O
their O
own O
journey O
had O
not O
by O
any O
circumstance O

been O
delayed O
a O
day! O

Her O
aunt O
now O
called O
her O
to O
look O
at O
a O
picture. O

She O
approached, O
and O
saw O
the O
likeness O
of O
Mr. O
Wickham B-Person
suspended, O

amongst O
several O
other O
miniatures B-Misc
, O
over O
the O
mantlepiece B-Misc
. O

Her O
aunt O
asked O
her, O
smilingly, O
how O
she O
liked O
it. O

The O
housekeeper O
came O
forward, O
and O
told O
them O
it O
was O
the O
picture O
of O
a O
young O
gentleman, O

the O
son O
of O
her O
late O
master's O
steward, O
who O
had O
been O
brought O
up O
by O
him O
at O
his O
own O
expence. O

"He O
is O
now O
gone O
into O
the O
army," O
she O
added, O
"but O
I O
am O
afraid O
he O
has O
turned O
out O
very O
wild." O

Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
looked O
at O
her O
niece O
with O
a O
smile, O
but O
Elizabeth B-Person
could O
not O
return O
it. O

"And O
that," O
said O
Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
, O
pointing O
to O
another O
of O
the O
miniatures B-Misc
, O

"is O
my O
master O
-- O
and O
very O
like O
him. O
It O
was O
drawn O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
the O
other O
-- O

about O
eight O
years O
ago." O

"I O
have O
heard O
much O
of O
your O
master's O
fine O
person," O
said O
Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O

looking O
at O
the O
picture; O
"it O
is O
a O
handsome O
face. O
But, O
Lizzy B-Person
, O

you O
can O
tell O
us O
whether O
it O
is O
like O
or O
not." O

Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
's O
respect O
for O
Elizabeth B-Person
seemed O
to O
increase O
on O
this O
intimation O
of O
her O

knowing O
her O
master. O

"Does O
that O
young O
lady O
know O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
?" O

Elizabeth B-Person
coloured, O
and O
said O
-- O
"A O
little." O

"And O
do O
not O
you O
think O
him O
a O
very O
handsome O
gentleman, O
Ma'am?" O

"Yes, O
very O
handsome." O

"I O
am O
sure O
I O
know O
none O
so O
handsome; O
but O
in O
the O
gallery O
up O
stairs O
you O
will O
see O
a O
finer, O

larger O
picture O
of O
him O
than O
this. O

This O
room O
was O
my O
late O
master's O
favourite O
room, O
and O
these O
miniatures B-Misc
are O
just O
as O
they O
used O
to O
be O
then. O
He O
was O
very O
fond O
of O
them." O

This O
accounted O
to O
Elizabeth B-Person
for O
Mr. O
Wickham B-Person
's O
being O
among O
them. O

Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
then O
directed O
their O
attention O
to O
one O
of O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
, O

drawn O
when O
she O
was O
only O
eight O
years O
old. O

"And O
is O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
as O
handsome O
as O
her O
brother?" O
said O
Mr. O
Gardiner B-Person
. O

"Oh! O
yes O
-- O
the O
handsomest O
young O
lady O
that O
ever O
was O
seen; O

and O
so O
accomplished! O
-- O
She O
plays O
and O
sings O
all O
day O
long. O

In O
the O
next O
room O
is O
a O
new O
instrument O
just O
come O
down O
for O
her O
-- O
a O
present O
from O
my O
master; O

she O
comes O
here O
to-morrow O
with O
him." O

Mr. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O
whose O
manners O
were O
easy O
and O
pleasant, O

encouraged O
her O
communicativeness O
by O
his O
questions O
and O
remarks; O

Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
, O
either O
from O
pride O
or O
attachment, O

had O
evidently O
great O
pleasure O
in O
talking O
of O
her O
master O
and O
his O
sister. O

"Is O
your O
master O
much O
at O
Pemberley B-Location
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
year?" O

"Not O
so O
much O
as O
I O
could O
wish, O
Sir; O
but O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
may O
spend O
half O
his O
time O
here; O

and O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
is O
always O
down O
for O
the O
summer O
months." O

"Except," O
thought O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O
"when O
she O
goes O
to O
Ramsgate B-Location
." O

"If O
your O
master O
would O
marry, O
you O
might O
see O
more O
of O
him." O

"Yes, O
Sir; O
but O
I O
do O
not O
know O
when O
that O
will O
be. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
who O
is O
good O
enough O
for O
him." O

Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
smiled. O
Elizabeth B-Person
could O
not O
help O
saying, O

"It O
is O
very O
much O
to O
his O
credit, O
I O
am O
sure, O
that O
you O
should O
think O
so." O

"I O
say O
no O
more O
than O
the O
truth, O
and O
what O
every O
body O
will O
say O
that O
knows O
him," O

replied O
the O
other. O
Elizabeth B-Person
thought O
this O
was O
going O
pretty O
far; O

and O
she O
listened O
with O
increasing O
astonishment O
as O
the O
housekeeper O
added, O

"I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
cross O
word O
from O
him O
in O
my O
life, O

and O
I O
have O
known O
him O
ever O
since O
he O
was O
four O
years O
old." O

This O
was O
praise, O
of O
all O
others O
most O
extraordinary, O
most O
opposite O
to O
her O
ideas. O

That O
he O
was O
not O
a O
good O
tempered O
man O
had O
been O
her O
firmest O
opinion. O

Her O
keenest O
attention O
was O
awakened; O

she O
longed O
to O
hear O
more, O
and O
was O
grateful O
to O
her O
uncle O
for O
saying, O

"There O
are O
very O
few O
people O
of O
whom O
so O
much O
can O
be O
said. O

You O
are O
lucky O
in O
having O
such O
a O
master." O

"Yes, O
Sir, O
I O
know O
I O
am. O
If O
I O
was O
to O
go O
through O
the O
world, O

I O
could O
not O
meet O
with O
a O
better. O

But O
I O
have O
always O
observed O
that O
they O
who O
are O
good-natured O
when O
children O
are O
good-natured O

when O
they O
grow O
up; O
and O
he O
was O
always O
the O
sweetest-tempered, O

most O
generous-hearted, O
boy O
in O
the O
world." O

Elizabeth B-Person
almost O
stared O
at O
her. O
-- O
"Can O
this O
be O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
!" O
thought O
she. O

"His O
father O
was O
an O
excellent O
man," O
said O
Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
. O

"Yes, O
Ma'am, O
that O
he O
was O
indeed; O
and O
his O
son O
will O
be O
just O
like O
him O
-- O
just O
as O
affable O
to O
the O
poor." O

Elizabeth B-Person
listened, O
wondered, O
doubted, O
and O
was O
impatient O
for O
more. O
Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person

could O
interest O
her O
on O
no O
other O
point. O

She O
related O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
pictures, O
the O
dimensions O
of O
the O
rooms, O
and O
the O
price O
of O
the O
furniture, O
in O
vain. O
Mr. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O
highly O
amused O
by O
the O
kind O
of O
family O
prejudice O
to O
which O

he O
attributed O
her O
excessive O
commendation O
of O
her O
master, O

soon O
led O
again O
to O
the O
subject; O
and O
she O
dwelt O
with O
energy O
on O
his O
many O
merits, O

as O
they O
proceeded O
together O
up O
the O
great O
staircase B-Misc
. O

"He O
is O
the O
best O
landlord, O
and O
the O
best O
master," O
said O
she, O
"that O
ever O
lived. O

Not O
like O
the O
wild O
young O
men O
now-a-days, O
who O
think O
of O
nothing O
but O
themselves. O

There O
is O
not O
one O
of O
his O
tenants O
or O
servants O
but O
what O
will O
give O
him O
a O
good O
name. O

Some O
people O
call O
him O
proud; O
but O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
never O
saw O
any O
thing O
of O
it. O

To O
my O
fancy, O
it O
is O
only O
because O
he O
does O
not O
rattle O
away O
like O
other O
young O
men." O

"In O
what O
an O
amiable O
light O
does O
this O
place O
him!" O
thought O
Elizabeth B-Person
. O

"This O
fine O
account O
of O
him," O
whispered O
her O
aunt, O
as O
they O
walked, O

"is O
not O
quite O
consistent O
with O
his O
behaviour O
to O
our O
poor O
friend." O

"Perhaps O
we O
might O
be O
deceived." O

"That O
is O
not O
very O
likely; O
our O
authority O
was O
too O
good." O

On O
reaching O
the O
spacious O
lobby B-Misc
above, O
they O
were O
shewn O
into O
a O
very O
pretty O
sitting B-Misc
room I-Misc
, O
lately O
fitted O
up O
with O
greater O
elegance O
and O
lightness O
than O
the O
apartments B-Misc
below; O

and O
were O
informed O
that O
it O
was O
but O
just O
done O
to O
give O
pleasure O
to O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
, O

who O
had O
taken O
a O
liking O
to O
the O
room O
when O
last O
at O
Pemberley B-Location
. O

"He O
is O
certainly O
a O
good O
brother," O
said O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O

as O
she O
walked O
towards O
one O
of O
the O
window B-Misc
. O

Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
anticipated O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
's O
delight O
when O
she O
should O
enter O
the O
room. O
"And O
this O
is O
always O
the O
way O
with O
him," O
she O
added. O
-- O
"Whatever O
can O
give O
his O
sister O
any O
pleasure O
is O
sure O
to O
be O
done O
in O
a O
moment. O
There O
is O
nothing O
he O
would O
not O
do O
for O
her." O

The O
picture B-Misc
gallery I-Misc
, O
and O
two O
or O
three O
of O
the O
principal O
bedrooms, O
were O
all O
that O
remained O
to O
be O
shewn. O
In O
the O
former O
were O
many O
good O
paintings; O
but O
Elizabeth B-Person
knew O
nothing O
of O
the O
art; O
and O
from O
such O
as O
had O
been O
already O
visible O
below, O
she O
had O
willingly O
turned O
to O
look O
at O
some O

drawings O
of O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
's, O
in O
crayons, O
whose O
subjects O
were O
usually O
more O
interesting, O

and O
also O
more O
intelligible. O

In O
the O
gallery O
there O
were O
many O
family O
portraits B-Misc
, O
but O
they O
could O
have O
little O
to O
fix O
the O
attention O
of O

a O
stranger. O
Elizabeth B-Person
walked O
on O
in O
quest O
of O
the O
only O
face O
whose O
features O
would O
be O
known O

to O
her. O
At O
last O
it O
arrested O
her O
-- O
and O
she O
beheld O
a O
striking O
resemblance O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
, O

with O
such O
a O
smile O
over O
the O
face O
as O
she O
remembered O
to O
have O
sometimes O
seen, O

when O
he O
looked O
at O
her. O
She O
stood O
several O
minutes O
before O
the O
picture O
in O
earnest O
contemplation, O

and O
returned O
to O
it O
again O
before O
they O
quitted O
the O
gallery. O
Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
informed O
them O
that O
it O
had O
been O
taken O
in O
his O
father's O
life O
time. O

There O
was O
certainly O
at O
this O
moment, O
in O
Elizabeth B-Person
's O
mind, O

a O
more O
gentle O
sensation O
towards O
the O
original O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
felt O
in O
the O
height O
of O
their O

acquaintance. O
The O
commendation O
bestowed O
on O
him O
by O
Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
was O
of O
no O
trifling O

nature. O

What O
praise O
is O
more O
valuable O
than O
the O
praise O
of O
an O
intelligent O
servant? O

As O
a O
brother, O
a O
landlord, O
a O
master, O
she O
considered O
how O
many O
people's O
happiness O
were O
in O
his O

guardianship! O
-- O
How O
much O
of O
pleasure O
or O
pain O
it O
was O
in O
his O
power O
to O
bestow! O

-- O
How O
much O
of O
good O
or O
evil O
must O
be O
done O
by O
him! O

Every O
idea O
that O
had O
been O
brought O
forward O
by O
the O
housekeeper O
was O
favourable O
to O
his O
character, O

and O
as O
she O
stood O
before O
the O
canvas B-Misc
, O
on O
which O
he O
was O
represented, O
and O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
upon O

herself, O
she O
thought O
of O
his O
regard O
with O
a O
deeper O
sentiment O
of O
gratitude O
than O
it O
had O
ever O
raised O

before; O
she O
remembered O
its O
warmth, O
and O
softened O
its O
impropriety O
of O
expression. O

When O
all O
of O
the O
house O
that O
was O
open O
to O
general O
inspection O
had O
been O
seen, O

they O
returned O
down O
stairs, O
and, O
taking O
leave O
of O
the O
housekeeper, O

were O
consigned O
over O
to O
the O
gardener, O
who O
met O
them O
at O
the O
hall B-Misc
door#Misc*]. O

As O
they O
walked O
across O
the O
lawn B-Misc
towards O
the O
river B-Misc
, O
Elizabeth B-Person
turned O
back O
to O

look O
again; O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
stopped O
also, O
and O
while O
the O
former O
was O
conjecturing O
as O
to O
the O

date O
of O
the O
building B-Misc
, O
the O
owner O
of O
it O
himself O
suddenly O
came O
forward O
from O
the O
road B-Misc
, O

which O
led O
behind O
it O
to O
the O
stables. O

They O
were O
within O
twenty O
yards O
of O
each O
other, O
and O
so O
abrupt O
was O
his O
appearance, O

that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
avoid O
his O
sight. O
Their O
eyes O
instantly O
met, O
and O
the O
cheeks O
of O
each O
were O

overspread O
with O
the O
deepest O
blush. O

He O
absolutely O
started, O
and O
for O
a O
moment O
seemed O
immoveable O
from O
surprise; O

but O
shortly O
recovering O
himself, O
advanced O
towards O
the O
party, O
and O
spoke O
to O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O

if O
not O
in O
terms O
of O
perfect O
composure, O
at O
least O
of O
perfect O
civility. O

She O
had O
instinctively O
turned O
away; O
but, O
stopping O
on O
his O
approach, O

received O
his O
compliments O
with O
an O
embarrassment O
impossible O
to O
be O
overcome. O

Had O
his O
first O
appearance, O
or O
his O
resemblance O
to O
the O
picture O
they O
had O
just O
been O
examining, O

been O
insufficient O
to O
assure O
the O
other O
two O
that O
they O
now O
saw O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
, O

the O
gardener's O
expression O
of O
surprise O
on O
beholding O
his O
master O
must O
immediately O
have O
told O
it. O

They O
stood O
a O
little O
aloof O
while O
he O
was O
talking O
to O
their O
niece, O
who, O
astonished O
and O
confused, O

scarcely O
dared O
lift O
her O
eyes O
to O
his O
face, O
and O
knew O
not O
what O
answer O
she O
returned O
to O
his O

civil O
enquiries O
after O
her O
family. O

Amazed O
at O
the O
alteration O
in O
his O
manner O
since O
they O
last O
parted, O
every O
sentence O
that O
he O
uttered O
was O
increasing O
her O
embarrassment; O
and O
every O
idea O
of O
the O
impropriety O
of O
her O
being O
found O
there O

recurring O
to O
her O
mind, O
the O
few O
minutes O
in O
which O
they O
continued O
together O
were O
some O
of O
the O
most O

uncomfortable O
of O
her O
life. O

Nor O
did O
he O
seem O
much O
more O
at O
ease; O
when O
he O
spoke, O

his O
accent O
had O
none O
of O
its O
usual O
sedateness; O

and O
he O
repeated O
his O
enquiries O
as O
to O
the O
time O
of O
her O
having O
left O
Long B-Location
bourn I-Location
, O

and O
of O
her O
stay O
in O
Derbyshire B-Location
, O
so O
often, O
and O
in O
so O
hurried O
a O
way, O
as O
plainly O
spoke O
the O

distraction O
of O
his O
thoughts. O

At O
length, O
every O
idea O
seemed O
to O
fail O
him; O
and, O
after O
standing O
a O
few O
moments O
without O
saying O
a O

word, O
he O
suddenly O
recollected O
himself, O
and O
took O
leave. O

The O
others O
then O
joined O
her, O
and O
expressed O
their O
admiration O
of O
his O
figure; O

but O
Elizabeth B-Person
heard O
not O
a O
word, O
and, O
wholly O
engrossed O
by O
her O
own O
feelings, O

followed O
them O
in O
silence. O

She O
was O
overpowered O
by O
shame O
and O
vexation. O

Her O
coming O
there O
was O
the O
most O
unfortunate, O
the O
most O
ill-judged O
thing O
in O
the O
world! O

How O
strange O
must O
it O
appear O
to O
him! O

In O
what O
a O
disgraceful O
light O
might O
it O
not O
strike O
so O
vain O
a O
man! O

It O
might O
seem O
as O
if O
she O
had O
purposely O
thrown O
herself O
in O
his O
way O
again! O

Oh! O
why O
did O
she O
come? O
or, O
why O
did O
he O
thus O
come O
a O
day O
before O
he O
was O
expected? O

Had O
they O
been O
only O
ten O
minutes O
sooner, O

they O
should O
have O
been O
beyond O
the O
reach O
of O
his O
discrimination, O

for O
it O
was O
plain O
that O
he O
was O
that O
moment O
arrived, O

that O
moment O
alighted O
from O
his O
horse B-Misc
or O
his O
carriage B-Misc
. O

She O
blushed O
again O
and O
again O
over O
the O
perverseness O
of O
the O
meeting. O

And O
his O
behaviour, O
so O
strikingly O
altered, O
-- O
what O
could O
it O
mean? O

That O
he O
should O
even O
speak O
to O
her O
was O
amazing! O

but O
to O
speak O
with O
such O
civility, O
to O
enquire O
after O
her O
family! O

Never O
in O
her O
life O
had O
she O
seen O
his O
manners O
so O
little O
dignified, O

never O
had O
he O
spoken O
with O
such O
gentleness O
as O
on O
this O
unexpected O
meeting. O

What O
a O
contrast O
did O
it O
offer O
to O
his O
last O
address O
in O
Rosings B-Location
Park I-Location
, O

when O
he O
put O
his O
letter O
into O
her O
hand! O

She O
knew O
not O
what O
to O
think, O
nor O
how O
to O
account O
for O
it. O

They O
had O
now O
entered O
a O
beautiful O
walk O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the B-Misc
water I-Misc
, O

and O
every O
step O
was O
bringing O
forward O
a O
nobler O
fall O
of O
ground B-Misc
, O

or O
a O
finer O
reach O
of O
the O
wood B-Misc
s O
to O
which O
they O
were O
approaching; O

but O
it O
was O
some O
time O
before O
Elizabeth B-Person
was O
sensible O
of O
any O
of O
it; O

and, O
though O
she O
answered O
mechanically O
to O
the O
repeated O
appeals O
of O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt, O

and O
seemed O
to O
direct O
her O
eyes O
to O
such O
objects O
as O
they O
pointed O
out, O

she O
distinguished O
no O
part O
of O
the O
scene. O

Her O
thoughts O
were O
all O
fixed O
on O
that O
one O
spot O
of O
Pemberley B-Location
House I-Location
, O

whichever O
it O
might O
be, O
where O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
then O
was. O

She O
longed O
to O
know O
what O
at O
that O
moment O
was O
passing O
in O
his O
mind; O

in O
what O
manner O
he O
thought O
of O
her, O
and O
whether, O
in O
defiance O
of O
every O
thing, O

she O
was O
still O
dear O
to O
him. O

Perhaps O
he O
had O
been O
civil O
only O
because O
he O
felt O
himself O
at O
ease; O

yet O
there O
had O
been O
that O
in O
his O
voice O
which O
was O
not O
like O
ease. O

Whether O
he O
had O
felt O
more O
of O
pain O
or O
of O
pleasure O
in O
seeing O
her, O
she O
could O
not O
tell, O

but O
he O
certainly O
had O
not O
seen O
her O
with O
composure. O

At O
length, O
however, O
the O
remarks O
of O
her O
companions O
on O
her O
absence O
of O
mind O
roused O
her, O

and O
she O
felt O
the O
necessity O
of O
appearing O
more O
like O
herself. O

They O
entered O
the O
wood B-Misc
s, O
and O
bidding O
adieu O
to O
the O
river B-Misc
for O
a O
while, O

ascended O
some O
of O
the O
higher O
ground B-Misc
s; O

whence, O
in O
spots O
where O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
trees B-Misc
gave O
the O
eye O
power O
to O
wander, O

were O
many O
charming O
views O
of O
the O
valley B-Misc
, O
the O
opposite O
hills B-Misc
, O

with O
the O
long O
range O
of O
wood B-Misc
s O
overspreading O
many, O
and O
occasionally O
part O
of O
the O
stream B-Misc
. O

Mr. O
Gardiner B-Person
expressed O
a O
wish O
of O
going O
round O
the O
whole B-Location
Park I-Location
, O

but O
feared O
it O
might O
be O
beyond O
a O
walk. O

With O
a O
triumphant O
smile, O
they O
were O
told O
that O
it O
was O
ten O
miles O
round. O

It O
settled O
the O
matter; O
and O
they O
pursued O
the O
accustomed O
circuit; O

which O
brought O
them O
again, O
after O
some O
time, O
in O
a O
descent O
among O
hanging O
wood B-Misc
s, O

to O
the O
edge O
of O
the B-Misc
water I-Misc
, O
in O
one O
of O
its O
narrowest O
parts. O

They O
crossed O
it O
by O
a O
simple O
bridge B-Misc
, O
in O
character O
with O
the O
general O
air O
of O
the O
scene; O

it O
was O
a O
spot O
less O
adorned O
than O
any O
they O
had O
yet O
visited; O

and O
the O
valley B-Misc
, O
here O
contracted O
into O
a O
glen, O
allowed O
room O
only O
for O
the O
stream B-Misc
, O

and O
a O
narrow O
walk O
amidst O
the O
rough O
coppice B-Misc
- O
wood B-Misc
which O
bordered O
it. O

Elizabeth B-Person
longed O
to O
explore O
its O
windings; O

but O
when O
they O
had O
crossed O
the O
bridge B-Misc
, O
and O
perceived O
their O
distance O
from O
the O
house, O

Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O
who O
was O
not O
a O
great O
walker, O
could O
go O
no O
farther, O

and O
thought O
only O
of O
returning O
to O
the O
carriage B-Misc
as O
quickly O
as O
possible. O

Her O
niece O
was, O
therefore, O
obliged O
to O
submit, O

and O
they O
took O
their O
way O
towards O
the O
house B-Misc
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
the O
river B-Misc
, O

in O
the O
nearest O
direction; O
but O
their O
progress O
was O
slow, O
for O
Mr. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O

though O
seldom O
able O
to O
indulge O
the O
taste, O
was O
very O
fond O
of O
fishing, O

and O
was O
so O
much O
engaged O
in O
watching O
the O
occasional O
appearance O
of O
some O
trout O
in O
the B-Misc
water I-Misc
, O
and O
talking O
to O
the O
man O
about O
them, O
that O
he O
advanced O
but O
little. O

Whilst O
wandering O
on O
in O
this O
slow O
manner, O
they O
were O
again O
surprised, O

and O
Elizabeth B-Person
's O
astonishment O
was O
quite O
equal O
to O
what O
it O
had O
been O
at O
first, O

by O
the O
sight O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
approaching O
them, O
and O
at O
no O
great O
distance. O

The O
walk O
being O
here O
less O
sheltered O
than O
on O
the O
other O
side, O

allowed O
them O
to O
see O
him O
before O
they O
met. O

Elizabeth B-Person
, O
however O
astonished, O
was O
at O
least O
more O
prepared O
for O
an O
interview O
than O
before, O

and O
resolved O
to O
appear O
and O
to O
speak O
with O
calmness, O
if O
he O
really O
intended O
to O
meet O
them. O

For O
a O
few O
moments, O
indeed, O
she O
felt O
that O
he O
would O
probably O
strike O
into O
some O
other O
path. O

This O
idea O
lasted O
while O
a O
turning O
in O
the O
walk O
concealed O
him O
from O
their O
view; O
the O
turning O
past, O
he O
was O
immediately O
before O
them. O
With O
a O
glance O
she O
saw O
that O
he O
had O
lost O
none O
of O
his O
recent O
civility; O
and, O
to O
imitate O
his O
politeness, O
she O
began, O
as O
they O
met, O
to O
admire O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
place; O

but O
she O
had O
not O
got O
beyond O
the O
words O
"delightful," O
and O
"charming," O

when O
some O
unlucky O
recollections O
obtruded, O
and O
she O
fancied O
that O
praise O
of O
Pemberley B-Location

from O
her O
might O
be O
mischievously O
construed. O
Her O
colour O
changed, O
and O
she O
said O
no O
more. O

Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
was O
standing O
a O
little O
behind; O
and O
on O
her O
pausing, O

he O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
would O
do O
him O
the O
honour O
of O
introducing O
him O
to O
her O
friends. O

This O
was O
a O
stroke O
of O
civility O
for O
which O
she O
was O
quite O
unprepared; O

and O
she O
could O
hardly O
suppress O
a O
smile O
at O
his O
being O
now O
seeking O
the O
acquaintance O
of O
some O
of O

those O
very O
people O
against O
whom O
his O
pride O
had O
revolted, O
in O
his O
offer O
to O
herself. O
" O

What O
will O
be O
his O
surprise," O
thought O
she, O
"when O
he O
knows O
who O
they O
are! O

He O
takes O
them O
now O
for O
people O
of O
fashion." O

The O
introduction, O
however, O
was O
immediately O
made; O

and O
as O
she O
named O
their O
relationship O
to O
herself, O
she O
stole O
a O
sly O
look O
at O
him, O

to O
see O
how O
he O
bore O
it; O
and O
was O
not O
without O
the O
expectation O
of O
his O
decamping O

as O
fast O
as O
he O
could O
from O
such O
disgraceful O
companions. O

That O
he O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
connexion O
was O
evident; O

he O
sustained O
it O
however O
with O
fortitude, O
and O
so O
far O
from O
going O
away, O
turned O
back O
with O
them, O

and O
entered O
into O
conversation O
with O
Mr. O
Gardiner B-Person
. O

Elizabeth B-Person
could O
not O
but O
be O
pleased, O
could O
not O
but O
triumph. O

It O
was O
consoling O
that O
he O
should O
know O
she O
had O
some O
relations O
for O
whom O
there O
was O
no O
need O
to O

blush. O

She O
listened O
most O
attentively O
to O
all O
that O
passed O
between O
them, O
and O
gloried O
in O
every O
expression, O

every O
sentence O
of O
her O
uncle, O
which O
marked O
his O
intelligence, O
his O
taste, O
or O
his O
good O
manners. O

The O
conversation O
soon O
turned O
upon O
fishing, O
and O
she O
heard O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
invite O
him, O

with O
the O
greatest O
civility, O
to O
fish O
there O
as O
often O
as O
he O
chose O

while O
he O
continued O
in O
the O
neighbourhood B-Location
, O
offering O
at O
the O
same O
time O
to O
supply O
him O

with O
fishing O
tackle, O
and O
pointing O
out O
those O
parts O
of O
the O
stream B-Misc
where O
there O
was O
usually O

most O
sport. O

Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O
who O
was O
walking O
arm O
in O
arm O
with O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O

gave O
her O
a O
look O
expressive O
of O
her O
wonder. O

Elizabeth B-Person
said O
nothing, O
but O
it O
gratified O
her O
exceedingly; O

the O
compliment O
must O
be O
all O
for O
herself. O

Her O
astonishment, O
however, O
was O
extreme; O

and O
continually O
was O
she O
repeating, O
"Why O
is O
he O
so O
altered? O
From O
what O
can O
it O
proceed? O

It O
cannot O
be O
for O
me, O
it O
cannot O
be O
for O
my O
sake O
that O
his O
manners O
are O
thus O
softened. O

My O
reproofs O
at O
Hunsford B-Location
could O
not O
work O
such O
a O
change O
as O
this. O

It O
is O
impossible O
that O
he O
should O
still O
love O
me." O

After O
walking O
some O
time O
in O
this O
way, O
the O
two O
ladies O
in O
front, O
the O
two O
gentlemen O
behind, O

on O
resuming O
their O
places O
after O
descending O
to O
the O
brink O
of O
the O
river B-Misc
for O
the O
better O
inspection O
of O
some O
curious O
water B-Misc
plant I-Misc
, O
there O
chanced O
to O
be O
a O
little O
alteration. O

It O
originated O
in O
Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O
who, O
fatigued O
by O
the O
exercise O
of O
the O
morning, O

found O
Elizabeth B-Person
's O
arm O
inadequate O
to O
her O
support, O

and O
consequently O
preferred O
her O
husband's. O

Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
took O
her O
place O
by O
her O
niece, O
and O
they O
walked O
on O
together. O

After O
a O
short O
silence, O
the O
lady O
first O
spoke. O

She O
wished O
him O
to O
know O
that O
she O
had O
been O
assured O
of O
his O
absence O
before O
she O
came O
to O
the O
place, O

and O
accordingly O
began O
by O
observing O
that O
his O
arrival O
had O
been O
very O
unexpected. O

she O
added, O
"informed O
us O
that O
you O
would O
certainly O
not O
be O
here O
till O
to-morrow; O

and O
indeed, O
before O
we O
left O
Bakewell B-Location
we O
understood O
that O
you O
were O
not O
immediately O

expected O
in O
the O
country B-Location
." O
He O
acknowledged O
the O
truth O
of O
it O
all; O

and O
said O
that O
business O
with O
his O
steward O
had O
occasioned O
his O
coming O
forward O
a O
few O
hours O
before O

the O
rest O
of O
the O
party O
with O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
travelling. O

"They O
will O
join O
me O
early O
tomorrow," O
he O
continued, O
"and O
among O
them O
are O
some O
who O
will O

claim O
an O
acquaintance O
with O
you, O
-- O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
and O
his O
sisters." O

Elizabeth B-Person
answered O
only O
by O
a O
slight O
bow. O

Her O
thoughts O
were O
instantly O
driven O
back O
to O
the O
time O
when O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
's O
name O
had O
been O

last O
mentioned O
between O
them; O

and O
if O
she O
might O
judge O
from O
his O
complexion, O
his O
mind O
was O
not O
very O
differently O
engaged. O

"There O
is O
also O
one O
other O
person O
in O
the O
party," O
he O
continued O
after O
a O
pause, O

"who O
more O
particularly O
wishes O
to O
be O
known O
to O
you, O

Will O
you O
allow O
me, O
or O
do O
I O
ask O
too O
much, O
to O
introduce O
my O
sister O
to O
your O
acquaintance O

during O
your O
stay O
at O
Lambton B-Location
?" O

The O
surprise O
of O
such O
an O
application O
was O
great O
indeed; O

it O
was O
too O
great O
for O
her O
to O
know O
in O
what O
manner O
she O
acceded O
to O
it. O

She O
immediately O
felt O
that O
whatever O
desire O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
might O
have O
of O
being O
acquainted O

with O
her O
must O
be O
the O
work O
of O
her O
brother, O
and O
without O
looking O
farther, O

it O
was O
satisfactory; O
it O
was O
gratifying O
to O
know O
that O
his O
resentment O
had O
not O
made O
him O
think O
really O

ill O
of O
her. O

They O
now O
walked O
on O
in O
silence; O
each O
of O
them O
deep O
in O
thought. O

Elizabeth B-Person
was O
not O
comfortable; O

that O
was O
impossible; O

but O
she O
was O
lattered O
and O
pleased. O

His O
wish O
of O
introducing O
his O
sister O
to O
her O
was O
a O
compliment O
of O
the O
highest O
kind. O

They O
soon O
outstripped O
the O
others, O
and O
when O
they O
had O
reached O
the O
carriage B-Misc
, O

Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
were O
half O
a O
quarter O
of O
a O
mile O
behind. O

He O
then O
asked O
her O
to O
walk O
into O
the O
house B-Misc
-- O
but O
she O
declared O
herself O
not O
tired, O

and O
they O
stood O
together O
on O
the O
lawn B-Misc
. O
At O
such O
a O
time, O
much O
might O
have O
been O
said, O

and O
silence O
was O
very O
awkward. O

She O
wanted O
to O
talk, O
but O
there O
seemed O
an O
embargo O
on O
every O
subject. O

At O
last O
she O
recollected O
that O
she O
had O
been O
travelling, O

and O
they O
talked O
of O
Matlock B-Location
and O
Dove B-Location
Dale I-Location
with O
great O
perseverance. O

Yet O
time O
and O
her O
aunt O
moved O
slowly O
-- O
and O
her O
patience O
and O
her O
ideas O
were O
nearly O
worn O
out. O

On O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
's O
coming O
up, O

they O
were O
all O
pressed O
to O
go O
into O
the O
house B-Location
and O
take O
some O
refreshment; O

but O
this O
was O
declined, O
and O
they O
parted O
on O
each O
side O
with O
the O
utmost O
politeness. O

Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
handed O
the O
ladies O
into O
the O
carriage B-Misc
, O
and O
when O
it O
drove O
off, O

Elizabeth B-Person
saw O
him O
walking O
slowly O
towards O
the O
house B-Location
. O

"To O
be O
sure, O
Lizzy B-Person
," O
said O
her O
aunt, O
"he O
is O
not O
so O
handsome O
as O
Wickham B-Person
; O
or O
rather O
he O
has O
not O
Wickham B-Person
's O
countenance, O
for O
his O
features O
are O
perfectly O
good. O
But O
how O
came O
you O
to O
tell O
us O
that O
he O
was O
so O
disagreeable?" O

Elizabeth B-Person
excused O
herself O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could; O

said O
that O
she O
had O
liked O
him O
better O
when O
they O
met O
in O
Kent B-Location
than O
before, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
never O
seen O
him O
so O
pleasant O
as O
this O
morning. O

"But O
perhaps O
he O
may O
be O
a O
little O
whimsical O
in O
his O
civilities," O
replied O
her O
uncle. O

"Your O
great O
men O
often O
are; O
and O
therefore O
I O
shall O
not O
take O
him O
at O
his O
word O
about O
fishing, O

as O
he O
might O
change O
his O
mind O
another O
day, O
and O
warn O
me O
off O
his O
grounds." O

Elizabeth B-Person
felt O
that O
they O
had O
entirely O
mistaken O
his O
character, O
but O
said O
nothing. O

"From O
what O
we O
have O
seen O
of O
him," O
continued O
Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O

"I O
really O
should O
not O
have O
thought O
that O
he O
could O
have O
behaved O
in O
so O
cruel O
a O
way O
by O
any O
body, O

as O
he O
has O
done O
by O
poor O
Wickham B-Person
. O

He O
has O
not O
an O
ill-natured O
look. O

On O
the O
contrary, O
there O
is O
something O
pleasing O
about O
his O
mouth O
when O
he O
speaks. O

And O
there O
is O
something O
of O
dignity O
in O
his O
countenance, O

that O
would O
not O
give O
one O
an O
unfavourable O
idea O
of O
his O
heart. O

But O
to O
be O
sure, O
the O
good O
lady O
who O
shewed O
us O
the O
house B-Location
did O
give O
him O
a O
most O

flaming O
character! O

I O
could O
hardly O
help O
laughing O
aloud O
sometimes. O
But O
he O
is O
a O
liberal O
master, O
I O
suppose, O
and O
that O
in O
the O
eye O
of O
a O
servant O
comprehends O
every O
virtue." O

Elizabeth B-Person
here O
felt O
herself O
called O
on O
to O
say O
something O
in O
vindication O
of O
his O
behaviour O
to O
Wickham B-Person
; O
and O
therefore O
gave O
them O
to O
understand, O
in O
as O
guarded O
a O
manner O
as O
she O
could, O

that O
by O
what O
she O
had O
heard O
from O
his O
relations O
in O
Kent B-Location
, O
his O
actions O
were O
capable O
of O
a O

very O
different O
construction; O
and O
that O
his O
character O
was O
by O
no O
means O
so O
faulty, O

nor O
Wickham B-Person
's O
so O
amiable, O
as O
they O
had O
been O
considered O
in O
Hertfordshire B-Location
. O
In O
confirmation O
of O
this, O
she O
related O
the O
particulars O
of O
all O
the O
pecuniary O
transactions O
in O
which O
they O
had O
been O
connected, O
without O
actually O
naming O
her O
authority, O
but O
stating O
it O
to O
be O
such O
as O
might O
be O
relied O
on. O

Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
was O
surprised O
and O
concerned; O
but O
as O
they O
were O
now O
approaching O
the O
scene O
of O
her O
former O
pleasures, O
every O
idea O
gave O
way O
to O
the O
charm O
of O
recollection; O
and O
she O
was O
too O
much O
engaged O
in O
pointing O
out O
to O
her O
husband O
all O
the O
interesting O
spots O
in O
its O
environs O
to O
think O
of O
any O
thing O
else. O
Fatigued O
as O
she O
had O
been O
by O
the O
morning's O
walk, O
they O
had O
no O
sooner O
dined O
than O
she O
set O
off O
again O
in O
quest O
of O
her O
former O
acquaintance, O
and O
the O
evening O
was O
spent O
in O
the O
satisfactions O
of O
an O
intercourse O
renewed O
after O
many O
years O
discontinuance. O

The O
occurrences O
of O
the O
day O
were O
too O
full O
of O
interest O
to O
leave O
Elizabeth B-Person
much O
attention O
for O
any O
of O
these O
new O
friends; O
and O
she O
could O
do O
nothing O
but O
think, O
and O
think O
with O
wonder, O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
's O
civility, O
and O
above O
all, O
of O
his O
wishing O
her O
to O
be O
acquainted O
with O
his O
sister. O
